                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Entrepreneur must be able to communicate effectively with clients, team members and all other
                        stakeholders. Whether through verbal communication during meetings or sending reports and
                        messages
                        through
                        emails about the project, entrepreneurs require superior written and verbal communication. Apart
                        from
                        communication skills, entrepreneurs must be excellent listeners to understand the project's
                        requirement
                        and
                        discussion during project meetings.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Being able to take calculated and intelligent risks is one of the essential entrepreneur skills
                        to learn.
                        Employees with an entrepreneur mindset never shy away from taking risks because they understand
                        that
                        calculated risks result in tremendous success. They know that risk is an opportunity to learn
                        and grow a
                        business to the next level. Employers want candidates who can take risks in pursuit of potential
                        gains
                        and
                        profit.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Networking involves building and managing relationship with other professionals to grow and
                        promote a
                        business. Effective networking skills open up future opportunities and help build a solid brand.
                        Networking allows entrepreneurs to meet like-minded professionals, build future teams and stay
                        up-to-date with industry
                        trends.It is one of the most desirable skills for entrepreneurs because, through a solid
                        network, they
                        can meet professionals to fund their ideas, access professional business expertise and get
                        feedback on
                        their new
                        venture or idea.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Critical thinking is an entrepreneur skill that objectively analyses the information and draws a
                        rational
                        conclusion. It helps entrepreneurs assess a situation and come up with a logical solution.
                        Employers
                        look for candidates with critical thinking because it helps solve problems and build strategies
                        for
                        business growth. Usually, a critical thinker is independent, competent and reflective. This
                        skill helps
                        entrepreneurs logically connect ideas, scrutinise information, evaluate arguments, find
                        inconsistencies
                        in work and solve complex issues. Instead of memorising information, such candidates use the
                        information
                        to deduce meaningful insights.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Often, entrepreneurs face challenging and unexpected situations. It could be a venture capitalist
                        refusing further funding or a team member refusing to work as per the project guidelines; an
                        entrepreneur must possess excellent problem-solving skills to handle stressful situations and
                        calmly
                        identify alternate solutions. Exceptional problem-solving skills ensure they reach their
                        business goal.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Creativity is a valuable yet underappreciated skill in the digital world. Creative thinking is
                        the
                        backbone for innovation and it forces employees to think differently. Entrepreneurs with
                        creative
                        thinking skills are never hesitant to try solutions that others may overlook because of fear of
                        failure.
                        Such people think out-of-the-box and always seek input from professionals in a different field
                        for
                        understanding a new perspective. It is one of the most sought-after entrepreneur skills because
                        it
                        allows them to see patterns (even when there are no patterns) and develop innovative ways to
                        solve
                        business issues.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Quality customer service promotes the brand and increases loyalty. Regardless of the industry,
                        excellent
                        customer service skills are essential for business success. From talking to clients to
                        discussing
                        funding opportunities, customer service skills help entrepreneurs connect with their potential
                        customers.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                        Apart
                        from this, they must know how to use accounting and budgeting software to keep track of all the
                        financial processes. By learning financial skills, entrepreneurs avoid overspending and
                        optimally
                        allocate resources.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Being able to inspire colleagues, empower the workforce and lead from the front requires
                        excellent
                        leadership skills. Exemplary leaders lead by examples and can take a leadership role and work as
                        a part
                        of a team. Entrepreneurs with leadership skills motivate their employees, manage operations and
                        delegate
                        tasks to reach the business goal.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Effective time management increases productivity and organises your workspace. Entrepreneurs with
                        time
                        management and organisational skills understand different ways to prioritise tasks and avoid
                        procrastination. For ensuring timely completion of projects, entrepreneurs analyse their and
                        their
                        team's time, set time limit for each task, complete priority tasks first, delegate work to
                        others,
                        create a to-do list and use technology to keep the workspace organised.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Technical skills are hard skills that are gained by using digital tools and software.
                        Entrepreneurs must
                        know how to use planning, marketing and budgeting software. Knowledge of software helps in
                        managing
                        projects, tracking sales and allocating a viable budget for the project.</p>
